      "content_html": "<p>PolyMC emerged out of frustration with the MultiMC project and therefore brought controversy with it.<br />\nIn short, the original founders of PolyMC had disagreements with the maintainer of MultiMC and the project's direction.<br />\nThese disagreements were turned into a takeover of packaging on Arch Linux by the PolyMC founders, something that, understandably, the <a href=\"https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/issues/75#issuecomment-1023571223\">MultiMC maintainers took as sabotage</a>.<br />\nAfter MultiMC <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/riitbs/multimc_is_dropping_all_support_for_aur_packages/\">dropped support for third-party packaging</a>, the seeds for PolyMC were laid.</p>\n<p>As a side note, we want to mention that we do not approve the actions of community members that used these controversies as a basis to harass MultiMC developers.<br />\nPlease refrain from brigading other communities.<br />\nIt only causes harm on both sides.</p>\n<p>PolyMC's inception is very controversial by its very nature.<br />\nThe founders have decided to sublicense PolyMC under the terms of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\">GNU General Public License 3</a> (GPL-3), which made it impossible for MultiMC to take contributions, without re-licensing to GPL-3 as well.<br />\nAs a result the MultiMC team have decided to burn bridges with PolyMC.<br />\nThis was manifested after access to the metadata service, provided by MultiMC, was <a href=\"https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/issues/75\">blocked for all PolyMC users</a>.<br />\nAll versions prior to 1.0.6 do not work anymore, as they try to reach MultiMC servers instead of our own.</p>\n<p>In an effort to prepare for our upcoming 1.1.0 release, we wanted to contact the MultiMC maintainer to see, if they want to be credited in our documentation.<br />\nSadly, our request was dismissed, and most of our team members were banned from the official MultiMC Discord server for being associated with PolyMC.</p>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of public chat with MultiMC maintainer\" src=\"https://polymc.org/img/news/moving-on/discord.png\" style=\"width: 40em\" />\n<p>This has sparked many internal discussions both at PolyMC as well as MultiMC.<br />\nIn the end, we concluded that we will be moving on from our origins as a packaging-friendly fork of MultiMC.</p>\n<p>In our upcoming 1.1.0 release, you will be able to use new features that will differentiate PolyMC from MultiMC.<br />\nThe major new feature is the integrated mod downloader that supports Modrinth and CurseForge mods.<br />\nWe also plan to clean the codebase, remove obscure or old features and cruft in an effort to make it easier for new contributors to start working on PolyMC.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have reorganized PolyMC since its inception to be more community-centric.<br />\nOne of the founders has stepped down as a maintainer and we have formed the <em>PolyMC Core Team</em>.<br />\nYou can read more about it in <a href=\"https://polymc.org/news/new-maintainers/\">this blogpost</a>.</p>\n<p>We want to decouple this project from its controversial origins and start work on a powerful Minecraft launcher.<br />\nWhile we are working on getting 1.1.0 out, check out our future plans:</p>\n<p><strong>Sneak peak of future plans</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewrite of metadata generators, to make them easier to work with. See progress over on <a href=\"https://github.com/PolyMC/polymorphosis\">PolyMC/polymorphosis</a></li>\n<li>Potential rewrite of the launch-mechanism for Minecraft. This will give future alternative launchers the tools to build their own.
