          Install and launch modpacks easily, while keeping them clean.
          No longer do you need to manually install them, and updating feature is coming soon. PolyMC can do that for you, without installing tons of separate launchers.

          Are you tired of manually switching mods for different versions, installing modloaders?<p>
          <p>PolyMC can help. Each Minecraft instance has its own folder, with separate mods, resourcepacks and other things.</p>

          You don't need an embedded web browser for a game launcher. PolyMC uses the Qt toolkit, which requires little system resources. PolyMC also supports customizing the instance window and theme.
