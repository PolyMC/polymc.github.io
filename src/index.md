        Install and launch modpacks easily, while keeping them clean.
        No longer do you need to manually install and update. PolyMC can do that for you, without installing tons of separate launchers

        <p>Did your settings ever reset after launching an older version? Did you ever accidentally break a world because you opened it in an old version?
        Are you tired of manually switching mods for different versions, installing modloaders?<p>
        <p>PolyMC can help. Each Minecraft instance has it's own folder, with separate mods, resourcepacks and other things.</p>

        You don't need an embedded web browser for a game launcher. PolyMC uses the Qt toolkit, which requires little system resources.
