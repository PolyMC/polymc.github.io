Dear @peterix,

please stop harassing developers and users associated with PolyMC and similar FOSS projects, just because you are concerned about the MultiMC *brand*.
Users have identified a problem with your approach to FOSS and have built an alternative to MultiMC.
Your reaction was dismissive and derogatory.
You have [locked us out of your metadata service][gh-poly-meta], called us *leeches* and stated we were doing an alleged *hostile takeover*.
All of this while we are following the clear Apache 2.0 license of MultiMC, and therefore following the terms **you** have decided, fit the project.
We don't expect you to support us, but diplomacy should be the way to go, rather than taking our users hostage by locking them out of your metadata service.

But if it had ended there this open letter wouldn't exist.
You are blocking people on GitHub and banning users on your Discord servers, just for being associated with this project.
You are calling people **idiots** and **assholes** for trying to develop an alternative offering to yours.

Why did you choose to make your software free and open source, if you don't want people to exercise these privileges?
You went as far as registering the MultiMC trademark in your home country.
That's totally fine, but then expect people to take your work, rebrand it (as you want them to) and distribute it on their own.

PolyMC is not an evil hostile takeover of the MultiMC brand or your past work, but rather a response to the increasingly more restrictive environment you are trying to build.
You can call us **idealists**, but at the end we just want an actual free and open source Minecraft launcher.

The reason we are writing this is because of your latest actions.
We are currently preparing the release of PolyMC 1.1.0, which includes many features and small changes that were developed by community members.
One of the things we wanted to figure out, is how to credit all the work that went into this upcoming release.
Probably 90% of the codebase is your work, and we felt it would be appropriate to credit you for that.
But to avoid PolyMC support emails arriving in your inbox, we wanted to get your opinion on this.

So @Scrumplex asked in the MultiMC Discord server (in the public #dev-talk channel on Feb 13, 2022 at 22:38 UTC):

![@Scrumplex asking in MultiMC Discord, how to credit @peterix](/assets/img/news/open-letter-to-mmc/discord-1.png)

Your response was rather unexpected and disrespectful:

![@peterix banning and insulting @Scrumplex](/assets/img/news/open-letter-to-mmc/discord-2.png)

Shortly after this you announced that you will be re-licensing the codebase under a license that's incompatible with the GPL, as well as adding a contributor license agreement (CLA).

![@peterix announcing a re-license and a CLA](/assets/img/news/open-letter-to-mmc/discord-3.png)

I think this will deter even more people from contributing to your project and will cause many raised brows.

Shortly after this you have banned everyone that's associated with PolyMC from all communication channels.
We are not allowed to collaborate with you or the other contributors.
We are being labeled as **assholes** and "FOSS zealots".

We are unsatisfied with this situation, as we tried to communicate on a diplomatic level, but you pulled out the nukes without hesitation.

When you introduce a CLA we will be going seperate ways and will be wishing you luck with your future endeavors.
