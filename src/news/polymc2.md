## Removed lots of bloat

![DeadCat](/img/af/dead-cat.png)
If you’re anything like us, then you must hate bloatware. That’s why, starting today, we’ve further simplified PolyMC’s code-base by making the tough decision, to put the cat down. Not just did he have an unbearable amount of flees, he also took up approximately 3 lines of code. That’s 3 lines too many in our book.
