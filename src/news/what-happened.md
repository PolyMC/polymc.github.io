# What happened?
A team restructure occurred that unfortunately led people to spread false information about the state of our metadata servers
and update servers. However, these remain safe to users, and we're dedicated to the privacy and security of PolyMC users now and in the future.

# What's next for PolyMC?

Well, we're on the same path, bringing you cool new features, and looking at your feedback to plan new features.
We are looking forward to the future, and wishing the best to all the forks out there.

~PolyMC Team
