# What happened?
A team restructure occured, that unfortunatly lead people to spread false information about the state of our metadata servers
and update servers, these remain safe to users and we're dedicated to the security of users of PolyMC now and in the future.

# What's next for PolyMC?

Well we're on the same path, bringing you cool and new features, and looking at your feedback to plan new features.
We are looking forward to the future, and wishing the best to all the forks out there.
~PolyMC Team
