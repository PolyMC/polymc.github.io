# Why this

Once opon a time, OF was the best way to make your game better. Things changed.

## Sodium
Sodium is the best client side optimization mod at the moment and it's highly raccomended.
To install in PolyMC, create a fabric instance, the go to the mods tab and click "Download Mods". There, click on Sodium, click select for mod instalation and then Ok
## Iris
Iris allows you to run OF Shaders while using Sodium. It works great, but it doesn't support every shaderpack at the moment.
Click [here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md) a list of currently supported shaderpacks
To install in PolyMC, create a fabric instance, the go to the mods tab and click "Download Mods". There, click on Iris, click select for mod instalation and then Ok

## other mods
I can't list every mod here, you can find a big list of optifine alternatives [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/)

# Fabulosly Optimized

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, the [Fabulosly Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) modpack is for you!

See the MultiMC/MultiMC (auto-update) guide to install it, they work on PolyMC too.
